# Ticket Desk

### What is this?
Ticket desk was a concept of mine that I decided to prototype using react. I currently work with a ticketing system that is overly complicated and not optimized for the user experience. It got me thinking... what is the minimal amount of information I need to solve problems for my users? How can I display this information in a clear and concise way? A few hours of playing around in Sketch this prototype concept was born. I have a very minimal design sense and feel that this concept displays the information I have to dig for while working in my current environment. Just for fun... and practice... enjoy!
